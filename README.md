# Supershulkers

This is just a mod to add a little flourish to @gnembom's shulkerboxes [script](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet/blob/master/programs/survival/shulkerboxes.sc), which is itself based on Xisuma's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMu8T8KriQY). A lot of the code is copy-pasted from arxenix/better-shulkers, which is thankfully licensed with a permissive license.

## Known Issues

- using a grindstone to disenchant doesn't work
- anvils don't work properly (probably fixed)
